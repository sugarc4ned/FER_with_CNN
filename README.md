# FER_with_CNN
Facial Expression Recognition with Deep Learning
In this system, we are using the streamlit to create an website that are able to accept user use their own image to detect the faces. We are provided 3 option for input(image, video, real-time camera). For example, when we uploaded an image to server, the faces in the image below are having a square box and the emotion detected from the image.
